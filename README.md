# MNIST digit recognition problem
A simple feed forward neural network implementation for predicting handwritten digits.

The model is comprised of three neural layers:
  - **784** neurons in **input layer**
  - **200** neurons in **hidden layer**
  - **10** neurons in **output layer**

The activation function is **sigmoid**.

Training and testing was done in Phyton with Anaconda package.
